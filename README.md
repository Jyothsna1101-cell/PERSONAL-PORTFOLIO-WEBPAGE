Developer Portfolio page embodies a polished single‑page layout built entirely with semantic HTML5 and responsive CSS, starting with a <header> element rendered in charcoal gray background featuring centered page title and subtitle. Navigation implemented via <nav> uses a flexbox layout to display links horizontally and seamlessly shifts to a vertical stack on viewports narrower than 600 px through media queries . Main content enclosed within a .container capped at 1000 px width includes three distinct <section> blocks delineated by subtle bottom borders. An “About Me” section succinctly highlights full‑stack development skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. A “Projects” section displays three .project cards styled with white backgrounds, left teal borders, and soft drop shadows—showcasing a real‑time chat app built with React and Socket.IO, an interactive quiz app featuring instant feedback and animated progress bar, and the portfolio itself, underscoring responsive UI design. A “Contact” section provides email, LinkedIn, and GitHub information for easy professional engagement. Footer styled consistently with the header contains a copyright notice for 2025 within a <footer> element. Global CSS resets all margins, paddings, and applies box-sizing: border-box for layout consistency. Typography employs a sans‑serif font with line-height of 1.6 for readability. Color palette integrates light gray background (#f4f4f4), crisp white content panels, charcoal contrast (#222), and vibrant teal accents (#00bcd4). Responsive design principles—including fluid layout, flexbox use, and media query breakpoints—ensure seamless appearance across devices . Semantic markup using <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> enhances accessibility, SEO, and code clarity
